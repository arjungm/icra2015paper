Consistency between Fingertip and Tool frame

Reviewer 1:
===========
Mention reinforcement learning
> easy
Mention human aware learning
> easy
Hausdorff is wrong?
DTW is too short
Too much detail in online survey section
Few typos
Close the Loop

> outright state that the classifiers are prediciting the rating of a given trajectory

Reviewer 2:
===========
Discuss why Hausdorff and DTW are good features

> add a note, we didn't choose rather we selected a large set of relevant features that could apply towards characterising trajectories for the purposes of classification

Reviewer 3:
===========
Maximin Clearance
Go over features like legibility and predictability
Title is misleading - include human perception in title
3 ways to interpret the high-level bit
Do subject ratings evolve over time?

Joint limit ditance metric is unintuitive
> maybe there is a perception of joint limits in people and we would've have caught it
or
> informative or uninformative metric that  directly pertains to robot capability

Corrleations between metric-smoothness and rating-smoothness
> DO compute the correlation between metric-smoothness and rating-smoothness

Correlation between PathLength_elbow, PathLength_tip and the perceived efficiency
> DO compute this

nominal path source?
> It's a trajectory that was calculated using BFS
> piece-wise collection of straight lines

is the perception of the trajectory affected by the start and goal states?
> this is an open question about the initial config affects the perceptions
> could be explored further in a more exhaustive study

How do you reconcile that high wrist-tool-dtw for tasks that do require
