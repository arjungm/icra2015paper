Consistency between Fingertip and Tool frame

Reviewer 1:
===========
Mention reinforcement learning
[A]
Mention human aware learning
[A]
Hausdorff is wrong
[x] textbook citation or paper

DTW is too short
[x] textbook citation or paper

Close the Loop
[x] mention in future work

outright state that the classifiers are predicting the rating of a given trajectory
[S] - DONE

Reviewer 2:
===========
Discuss why Hausdorff and DTW are good features

> add a note, we didn't choose rather we selected a large set of relevant features that could apply towards characterising trajectories for the purposes of classification
[X]

Reviewer 3:
===========
Maximin Clearance,
Avg MinClearance = Feature
Max MinClearance = Objective
[?] check in moveit and in text

Go over features like legibility and predictability
[S] we're not dealing with objects in view
- Mentioned this in Discussion

Title is misleading - include human perception in title
[AS] come up with titles

3 ways to interpret the high-level bit
[S] 
- Clarified this in the text discussing the survey

Do subject ratings evolve over time?
[S] requires more data which is part of our plan
- Mentioned this in discussion

Joint limit ditance metric is unintuitive
> maybe there is a perception of joint limits in people and we would've have caught it
or
> informative or uninformative metric that directly pertains to robot capability
[S]
- Wrote one-line note in joint limit section

Corrleations between metric-smoothness and rating-smoothness
[S] DO compute the correlation between metric-smoothness and rating-smoothness

Correlation between PathLength_elbow, PathLength_tip and the perceived efficiency
[S] DO compute this

nominal path source?
[A] how did i compute it
> mention it is in workspace 3D xyz
> It's a trajectory that was calculated using BFS
> piece-wise collection of straight lines

is the perception of the trajectory affected by the start and goal states?
[S]
> this is an open question about the initial config affects the perceptions
> could be explored further in a more exhaustive study
- Noted in discussion

How do you reconcile that high wrist-tool-dtw for tasks that do require
[S] task of context specific features
> Jetchev's work on generating environments
> very task specific

============

Reviewer 2

(1) How does this generalize to other robots?
[S]
(2) Related work - main price et. al., learning objective functions for manipulation (Kalakrishnan), Learning trajectory preferences for manipulators via iterative improvement (Jan Peters)
[A]
(3) Mention, clarify criteria predicted by three classifiers
[S]
(4) Hausdorff distance, DTW - point to citations
[x]
(5) Too much detail for online survey
[-]
(6) Typos
[A]
(7) Add explanation on classifier instantiation, search document for typos
[S] - DONE

Reviewer 4

(1) Add intellectual merits of choosing the different features - 


Reviewer 5

(1) Check clearance calculations
[x]

(2) Clarify the metrics against the notion of legibility and predictability
 - mention why we have not computed it
[S]

(3) Joint limit distance does not play a big role
[S]

(4) correlation between human-observer rating of smoothness and calculated smoothness metric
[S]

(5) correlation between efficiency rating and path length in configuration and workspace 
[S]

(6) nominal path was never converted back into joint space - features were only computed based on their workspace projections
[x]

(7) Is the perception affected by where the start and goal states are - there were no features that were start or goal state specific - that's a topic for future work - environment agnostic 
[S]

(8) Task or context specific features may be useful - exhaustively generate more features
[S]

(9) Randomized planners - post-processing step helped in making the paths more smoother
[S]

(10) weighted combination in satisfying a cost function - estimating these weights would be nice
[S]

(11) Need more task and context specific features - maybe a comparison to observed human trajectories of the same task
[S]
