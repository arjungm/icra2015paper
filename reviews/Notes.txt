(5) Too much detail for online survey

(6) Typos

(7) Add explanation on classifier instantiation, search document for typos




Reviewer 4

(1) Add intellectual merits of choosing the different features - 


Reviewer 5

(1) Check clearance calculations

(2) Clarify the metrics against the notion of legibility and predictability
 - mention why we have not computed it

(3) Joint limit distance does not play a big role

(4)
