Reviewer 2

(1) How does this generalize to other robots?

(2) Related work - main price et. al., learning objective functions for manipulation (Kalakrishnan), Learning trajectory preferences for manipulators via iterative improvement (Jan Peters)

(3) Mention, clarify criteria predicted by three classifiers

(4) Hausdorff distance, DTW - point to citations

(5) Too much detail for online survey

(6) Typos

(7) Add explanation on classifier instantiation, search document for typos

Reviewer 4

(1) Add intellectual merits of choosing the different features - 


Reviewer 5

(1) Check clearance calculations

(2) Clarify the metrics against the notion of legibility and predictability
 - mention why we have not computed it

(3) Joint limit distance does not play a big role

(4) correlation between human-observer rating of smoothness and calculated smoothness metric

(5) correlation between efficiency rating and path length in configuration and workspace 

(6) nominal path was never converted back into joint space - features were only computed based on their workspace projections

(7) Is the perception affected by where the start and goal states are - there were no features that were start or goal state specific - that's a topic for future work - environment agnostic 

(8) Task or context specific features may be useful - exhaustively generate more features

(9) Randomized planners - post-processing step helped in making the paths more smoother

(10) weighted combination in satisfying a cost function - estimating these weights would be nice

(11) Need more task and context specific features - maybe a comparison to observed human trajectories of the same task
