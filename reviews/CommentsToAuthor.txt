The proposed work addresses new features and
classifications for estimating the importance of trajectory
features when influencing human observers. The work sheds
light in answering some difficult questions related to
generating high quality trajectories and also raises
interesting new avenues for research. On the weaknesses
side, the reviewers point out the need of a better analysis
justifying the proposed metrics and methods, and point out
several additional points needing clarification. These
points should be taken into account.
