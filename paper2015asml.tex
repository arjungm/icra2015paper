\begin{abstract}

Co-robots, i.e. robots that need to work close to people, will need to account for the preferences and expectations of their human 
co-workers in executing motions or actions. Consistent, legible and predictable motions are a key factor in making humans comfortable 
around robots. In this work, we take a first step towards designing motions that are more acceptable to human co-workers by asking 
people to rate robot motions generated in a variety of environments. Our approach is data-driven, i.e. we aim to use data from an online 
survey to inform good quality paths and trajectories. We compute a set of features for each trajectory and use the features 
and associated ratings to try add predict a quality score that represents how well the human observers liked the trajectory. We present an 
analysis of the dataset that we have collected, highlighting the features that dominate the trajectories that people prefer. We also 
present a classifier that will return the quality score for a given trajectory. Finally, we discuss how a data-driven approach using the 
results of this analysis can be used to help design better plans that are more acceptable to people.

\section{INTRODUCTION}

Robots working in industrial environments have traditionally been limited to simple, efficient point to point motions. Robotic workcells 
typically require a safety cage to prevent people from being getting close. Robotic motion generation, therefore, does not take 
into account any notion of the acceptability of motions for human observers. The need for more flexibility in manufacturing and logistics, 
though, has resulted in a greater need for robots that can work beside humans. As robots and people start becoming co-workers, taking 
human perception of robotic paths into account will become more important. Humans are able to predict and adjust their motions to 
account for the expectations and motions of their co-workers easily. For human co-workers to be comfortable, robots will similarly 
have to tailor their motions for the presence and actions of the people around them. 

In this work, we take a first step towards the ultimate goal of generating robotic arm motions in cluttered environments that are acceptable for human observers and co-workers. We start with a survey where human observers rate robot motion quality. We generated a range of trajectories across multiple environments with different planners. The motion planning problems we chose required a (simulated) robot to move its arm from a specified end-effector start position to a desired end-effector goal position. Movies of these trajectories from multiple viewpoints were then presented to human observers using an online survey tool. The users were asked to rate different attributes of the trajectories. We also computed a large set of features for each trajectory. The feature set was designed to be easily extensible across different types of robots and also captures the relationship between the trajectories and the environment. We use the feature set, coupled with machine learning techniques, to build a classifier that predicts the human rating for a given trajectory. The classifiers also help in identifying a set of features that are the most important in predicting human preferences for robot trajectories. The classifiers could also form the basis for a new {\em data-driven{ approach to motion planning. 

This paper is organized as follows. In Section~\ref{sec:background}, we first describe some of the existing approaches to designing better quality paths for robots. We also look at how human motion information has inspired work in designing better trajectories for robots. In Section~\ref{sec:survey}, we present details of the online survey including information about the types of trajectories and environments used. Section~\ref{sec:raw_results} presents raw results from the survey, including examples of trajectories that were rated well and badly. In Section~\ref{sec:analysis}, we present a set of features corresponding to the trajectories and use a machine learning approach to derive a classifier for predicting the rating of trajectories. In Section~\ref{sec:conclusion}, we conclude with a discussion of how our results could be used to design motion planners that generate more human-acceptable trajectories. 

\section{Background}

Robot motion study for industrial has been primarily influenced by the need to generate smooth jerk-free trajectories that minimize wear and tear of internal parts. In recent years, there has been more interest in the generation of motions for robots working in human environments, i.e. environments with clutter and people working next to the robots. Most attention, though, has been focused on generating {\em collision-free} motions. Examples include the use of randomized planners, trajectory optimization techniques and deterministic search-based techniques. Such approaches have also been modified to account for other types of constraints, e.g. dynamic constraints or process constraints arising from the task. 

Human motions have been the subject of recent stufy with the intent of determining whether there are certain motor or locomotor invariants that best describe human manipulation or locomotion. Human motion has been observed to be stereo-typical~\cite{Atkeson:85}, i.e. learned motion patterns that are repeatedly used. This requires less planning of individual motions and contributes to making human motions more deterministic and predictable. Human motion has also been found to be optimized Nyga et. al.~\cite{Nyga:2011} studied the reaching motions of several subjects in table-setting situations. 


\section{PROCEDURE FOR PAPER SUBMISSION}

\subsection{Selecting a Template (Heading 2)}

First, confirm that you have the correct template for your paper size. This template has been tailored for output on the US-letter paper size. 
It may be used for A4 paper size if the paper size setting is suitably modified.

\subsection{Maintaining the Integrity of the Specifications}

The template is used to format your paper and style the text. All margins, column widths, line spaces, and text fonts are prescribed; please do not alter them. You may note peculiarities. For example, the head margin in this template measures proportionately more than is customary. This measurement and others are deliberate, using specifications that anticipate your paper as one part of the entire proceedings, and not as an independent document. Please do not revise any of the current designations

\section{MATH}

Before you begin to format your paper~\cite{phillips2011sipp}, first write and save the content as a separate text file. Keep your text and graphic files separate until after the text has been formatted and styled. Do not use hard tabs, and limit use of hard returns to only one return at the end of a paragraph. Do not add any kind of pagination anywhere in the paper. Do not number text heads-the template will do that for you.

Finally, complete content and organizational editing before formatting. Please take note of the following items when proofreading spelling and grammar:

\subsection{Abbreviations and Acronyms} Define abbreviations and acronyms the first time they are used in the text, even after they have been defined in the abstract. Abbreviations such as IEEE, SI, MKS, CGS, sc, dc, and rms do not have to be defined. Do not use abbreviations in the title or heads unless they are unavoidable.

\subsection{Units}

\begin{itemize}

\item Use either SI (MKS) or CGS as primary units. (SI units are encouraged.) English units may be used as secondary units (in parentheses). An exception would be the use of English units as identifiers in trade, such as �3.5-inch disk drive�.
\item Avoid combining SI and CGS units, such as current in amperes and magnetic field in oersteds. This often leads to confusion because equations do not balance dimensionally. If you must use mixed units, clearly state the units for each quantity that you use in an equation.
\item Do not mix complete spellings and abbreviations of units: �Wb/m2� or �webers per square meter�, not �webers/m2�.  Spell out units when they appear in text: �. . . a few henries�, not �. . . a few H�.
\item Use a zero before decimal points: �0.25�, not �.25�. Use �cm3�, not �cc�. (bullet list)

\end{itemize}


\subsection{Equations}

The equations are an exception to the prescribed specifications of this template. You will need to determine whether or not your equation should be typed using either the Times New Roman or the Symbol font (please no other font). To create multileveled equations, it may be necessary to treat the equation as a graphic and insert it into the text after your paper is styled. Number equations consecutively. Equation numbers, within parentheses, are to position flush right, as in (1), using a right tab stop. To make your equations more compact, you may use the solidus ( / ), the exp function, or appropriate exponents. Italicize Roman symbols for quantities and variables, but not Greek symbols. Use a long dash rather than a hyphen for a minus sign. Punctuate equations with commas or periods when they are part of a sentence, as in

$$
\alpha + \beta = \chi \eqno{(1)}
$$

Note that the equation is centered using a center tab stop. Be sure that the symbols in your equation have been defined before or immediately following the equation. Use �(1)�, not �Eq. (1)� or �equation (1)�, except at the beginning of a sentence: �Equation (1) is . . .�

\subsection{Some Common Mistakes}
\begin{itemize}


\item The word �data� is plural, not singular.
\item The subscript for the permeability of vacuum ?0, and other common scientific constants, is zero with subscript formatting, not a lowercase letter �o�.
\item In American English, commas, semi-/colons, periods, question and exclamation marks are located within quotation marks only when a complete thought or name is cited, such as a title or full quotation. When quotation marks are used, instead of a bold or italic typeface, to highlight a word or phrase, punctuation should appear outside of the quotation marks. A parenthetical phrase or statement at the end of a sentence is punctuated outside of the closing parenthesis (like this). (A parenthetical sentence is punctuated within the parentheses.)
\item A graph within a graph is an �inset�, not an �insert�. The word alternatively is preferred to the word �alternately� (unless you really mean something that alternates).
\item Do not use the word �essentially� to mean �approximately� or �effectively�.
\item In your paper title, if the words �that uses� can accurately replace the word �using�, capitalize the �u�; if not, keep using lower-cased.
\item Be aware of the different meanings of the homophones �affect� and �effect�, �complement� and �compliment�, �discreet� and �discrete�, �principal� and �principle�.
\item Do not confuse �imply� and �infer�.
\item The prefix �non� is not a word; it should be joined to the word it modifies, usually without a hyphen.
\item There is no period after the �et� in the Latin abbreviation �et al.�.
\item The abbreviation �i.e.� means �that is�, and the abbreviation �e.g.� means �for example�.

\end{itemize}


\section{USING THE TEMPLATE}

Use this sample document as your LaTeX source file to create your document. Save this file as {\bf root.tex}. You have to make sure to use the cls file that came with this distribution. If you use a different style file, you cannot expect to get required margins. Note also that when you are creating your out PDF file, the source file is only part of the equation. {\it Your \TeX\ $\rightarrow$ PDF filter determines the output file size. Even if you make all the specifications to output a letter file in the source - if your filter is set to produce A4, you will only get A4 output. }

It is impossible to account for all possible situation, one would encounter using \TeX. If you are using multiple \TeX\ files you must make sure that the ``MAIN`` source file is called root.tex - this is particularly important if your conference is using PaperPlaza's built in \TeX\ to PDF conversion tool.

\subsection{Headings, etc}

Text heads organize the topics on a relational, hierarchical basis. For example, the paper title is the primary text head because all subsequent material relates and elaborates on this one topic. If there are two or more sub-topics, the next level head (uppercase Roman numerals) should be used and, conversely, if there are not at least two sub-topics, then no subheads should be introduced. Styles named �Heading 1�, �Heading 2�, �Heading 3�, and �Heading 4� are prescribed.

\subsection{Figures and Tables}

Positioning Figures and Tables: Place figures and tables at the top and bottom of columns. Avoid placing them in the middle of columns. Large figures and tables may span across both columns. Figure captions should be below the figures; table heads should appear above the tables. Insert figures and tables after they are cited in the text. Use the abbreviation �Fig. 1�, even at the beginning of a sentence.

\begin{table}[h]
\caption{An Example of a Table}
\label{table_example}
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|c||c|}
\hline
One & Two\\
\hline
Three & Four\\

\end{tabular}
\end{center}
\end{table}


   \begin{figure}[thpb]
      \centering
      \framebox{\parbox{3in}{We suggest that you use a text box to insert a graphic (which is ideally a 300 dpi TIFF or EPS file, with all fonts embedded) because, in an document, this method is somewhat more stable than directly inserting a picture.
}}
      %\includegraphics[scale=1.0]{figurefile}
      \caption{Inductance of oscillation winding on amorphous
       magnetic core versus DC bias magnetic field}
      \label{figurelabel}
   \end{figure}
   

Figure Labels: Use 8 point Times New Roman for Figure labels. Use words rather than symbols or abbreviations when writing Figure axis labels to avoid confusing the reader. As an example, write the quantity �Magnetization�, or �Magnetization, M�, not just �M�. If including units in the label, present them within parentheses. Do not label axes only with units. In the example, write �Magnetization (A/m)� or �Magnetization {A[m(1)]}�, not just �A/m�. Do not label axes with a ratio of quantities and units. For example, write �Temperature (K)�, not �Temperature/K.�

\section{CONCLUSIONS}

A conclusion section is not required. Although a conclusion may review the main points of the paper, do not replicate the abstract as the conclusion. A conclusion might elaborate on the importance of the work or suggest applications and extensions. 

\addtolength{\textheight}{-12cm}   % This command serves to balance the column lengths
                                  % on the last page of the document manually. It shortens
                                  % the textheight of the last page by a suitable amount.
                                  % This command does not take effect until the next page
                                  % so it should come on the page before the last. Make
                                  % sure that you do not shorten the textheight too much.
