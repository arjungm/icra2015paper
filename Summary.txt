1. This video shows example PR2 robot trajectories from a survey that we conducted to gauge human preference ratings for robot motions.
2. We also computed trajectory features and in the video you will see clips of trajectories with high and low values for some of the features. 
3. The features were used to train classifiers that could predict the human preference rating for a new trajectory.
